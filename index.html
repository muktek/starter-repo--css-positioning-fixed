        <p>I've gone to some of the best schools in America and lived in one of the world's poorest nations. That anger is not always productive; indeed, all too often it distracts attention from solving real problems; it keeps us from squarely facing our own complicity in our condition, and prevents the African-American community from forging the alliances it needs to bring about real change. It's been about you. troops and civilians.</p>

        <p>John Kerry believes in the Constitutional freedoms that have made our country the envy of the world, and he will never sacrifice our basic liberties, nor use faith as a wedge to divide us. Let me be clear. But by the time he was a young adult, he was an atheist. It was a peaceful and determined insistence upon the ideals at the center of America's founding. It is a sign of neither courage nor power to shoot rockets at sleeping children, or to blow up old women on a bus. There is no straight line to realize this promise.</p>

        <p>I thought of the 900 men and women - sons and daughters, husbands and wives, friends and neighbors, who won't be returning to their own hometowns. We have real enemies in the world. But they have helped shape the political landscape for at least a generation. These are the Americans that I know. It's because John McCain doesn't get it.</p>

        <p>And if we walk away now, if we simply retreat into our respective corners, we will never be able to come together and solve challenges like health care, or education, or the need to find good jobs for every American. We did not go by choice, we went because of necessity. Without these ingredients, elections alone do not make true democracy.</p>

        <p>My parents shared not only an improbable love, they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation. He contains within him the contradictions - the good and the bad - of the community that he has served diligently for so many years. So when they are told to bus their children to a school across town; when they hear that an African American is getting an advantage in landing a good job or a spot in a good college because of an injustice that they themselves never committed; when they're told that their fears about crime in urban neighborhoods are somehow prejudiced, resentment builds over time. I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination.</p>

        <p>This is not to say that race has not been an issue in the campaign. King's birthday at his home church, Ebenezer Baptist, in Atlanta. It will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what John F. Not with so many children to educate, and so many veterans to care for. 9/11 was an enormous trauma to our country.</p>

        <p>But we cannot walk away this time. America, we are better than these last eight years. These are the Americans that I know. And throughout history, Islam has demonstrated through words and deeds the possibilities of religious tolerance and racial equality. Freedom of religion is central to the ability of peoples to live together.</p>

        <p>I understand you switched venues at considerable expense and inconvenience because of unfair labor practices at the place you were going to be having this synod. If you don't have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from.</p>

        <p>Legalized discrimination - where blacks were prevented, often through violence, from owning property, or loans were not granted to African-American business owners, or black homeowners could not access FHA mortgages, or blacks were excluded from unions, or the police force, or fire departments - meant that black families could not amass any meaningful wealth to bequeath to future generations. If you have health care, my plan will lower your premiums. They claim that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a Trojan Horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values. And we will welcome all elected, peaceful governments - provided they govern with respect for all their people. We have the power to make the world we seek, but only if we have the courage to make a new beginning, keeping in mind what has been written.</p>

        <p>They must be pursued - and they must be defeated. In the young people who voted for the first time, and in those who got involved again after a very long time. We have the most powerful military on Earth, but that's not what makes us strong. The enduring faith of over a billion people is so much bigger than the narrow hatred of a few. We will help Iraq train its Security Forces and develop its economy.</p>
